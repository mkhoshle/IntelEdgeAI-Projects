# Project Overview
## Main Tasks

At a high level, I will:

  -  Propose a possible hardware solution
  -  Build out your application and test its performance on the DevCloud using multiple hardware types
  -  Compare the performance to see which hardware performed best
  -  Revise my proposal based on the test results

## The Scenarios

We've been provided three different scenarios that depict real-world problems based on different sectors where edge devices are typically deployed.

The three scenarios are:

  -  Scenario 1: Manufacturing Sector
  -  Scenario 2: Retail Sector
  -  Scenario 3: Transportation Sector


## Hardware Proposal

All of the scenarios involve people in queues, but each scenario will require different hardware. 
So your first task will be to determine which hardware might work for each scenarioâ€”and then explain our initial choice in a proposal document. 

## Benchmarks
The details of the benchmarks and the results can be found [here](https://github.com/mkhoshle/IntelEdgeAI-Projects/blob/master/Smart-Queuing-System/choose-the-right-hardware-proposal-template.pdf).
