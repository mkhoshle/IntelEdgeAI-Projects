# IntelEdgeAI-Projects

## About the Intel Edge AI for IoT Developers Nanodegree Program
The nanodegree program will introduce students to the Intel OpenVINO toolkit, which allows developers to deploy pre-trained deep learning models 
through a high-level C++ or Python inference engine API integrated with application logic. Based on convolutional neural networks, the OpenVINO 
toolkit allows to maximize application performance across a range of heterogeneous Intel architectures to deliver fast, efficient deep 
learning workloads.

At this program I learned about deployment of cutting-edge AI technologies at the edge. 
I completed three real-world projects, each reviewed and approved by Udacityâ€™s reviewer network which provided 
me with practitioner-level skill set in delivering AI at the edge.
